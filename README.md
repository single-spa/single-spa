## A javascript framework for front-end microservices

Build micro frontends that coexist and can ([but don't need to](https://single-spa.js.org/docs/faq.html#can-i-use-more-than-one-framework)) be written with their own framework. This allows you to:

- [Use multiple frameworks](/docs/single-spa-ecosystem.md#help-for-frameworks) on the same page [without refreshing the page](/docs/applications.md)
  ([React](https://github.com/single-spa/single-spa-react), [AngularJS](https://github.com/single-spa/single-spa-angularjs), [Angular](https://github.com/single-spa/single-spa-angular), [Ember](https://github.com/single-spa/single-spa-ember), or whatever you're using)
- Write new code, possibly with a new framework, without rewriting your existing app
- Lazy load code for improved initial load time.
