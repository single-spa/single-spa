## A javascript metaframework

Build micro frontends that coexist and can each be written with their own framework. This allows you to:
- [Use multiple frameworks](/docs/single-spa-ecosystem.md#help-for-frameworks) on the same page [without refreshing the page](/docs/applications.md)
  ([React](https://github.com/CanopyTax/single-spa-react), [AngularJS](https://github.com/CanopyTax/single-spa-angular1), [Angular](https://github.com/CanopyTax/single-spa-angular2), [Ember](https://github.com/CanopyTax/single-spa-ember), or whatever you're using)
- Write code using a new framework, without rewriting your existing app
- Lazy load code for improved initial load time.

## Documentation

You can find the single-spa documentation [on the website](https://single-spa.js.org/).  

Check out the [Getting Started](https://single-spa.js.org/docs/getting-started-overview.html) page for a quick overview.

## Demo and examples

A [live demo](https://single-spa.surge.sh) is available and the source code for that demo is available in the [single-spa-examples](https://github.com/CanopyTax/single-spa-examples) repository.

Also, you can check out [a simple webpack starter project](https://github.com/joeldenning/simple-single-spa-webpack-example) which is simpler and hopefully easier to get started with.
